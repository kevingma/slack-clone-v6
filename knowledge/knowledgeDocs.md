## Introduction

To travel internationally is to become increasingly unnerved by the way
American culture pervades the world. We cringe at the new indoor Mlimani
shopping mall in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. We shake our heads at the sight of
a McDonald’s on Tiananmen Square or a Nike factory in Malaysia. The
visual landscape of the world has become depressingly familiar. For
Americans the old joke has become bizarrely true: wherever we go, there we
are.

We have the uneasy feeling that our influence over the rest of the world is
coming at a great cost: loss of the world’s diversity and complexity. For all
our self-incrimination, however, we have yet to face our most disturbing
effect on the rest of the world. Our golden arches do not represent our most
troubling impact on other cultures; rather, it is how we are flattening the
landscape of the human psyche itself. We are engaged in the grand project of
Americanizing the world’s understanding of the human mind.

This might seem like an impossible claim to back up, as such a change
would be happening inside the conscious and unconscious thoughts of more
than six billion people. But there are telltale signs that have recently become
unmistakable. Particularly telling are the changing manifestations of mental
illnesses around the world. In the past two decades, for instance, eating
disorders have risen in Hong Kong and are now spreading to inland China.
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become the common diagnosis,
the lingua franca of human suffering, following wars and natural disasters. In
addition, a particularly Americanized version of depression is on the rise in
countries across the world.

What is the pathogen that has led to these outbreaks and epidemics? On
what currents do these illnesses travel?

Over the past thirty years, we Americans have been industriously
exporting our ideas about mental illness. Our definitions and treatments have
become the international standards. Although this has often been done with
the best of intentions, we’ve failed to foresee the full impact of these efforts.
It turns out that how a people in a culture think about mental illnesses—how
they categorize and prioritize the symptoms, attempt to heal them, and set
expectations for their course and outcome—influences the diseases
themselves. In teaching the rest of the world to think like us, we have been,
for better and worse, homogenizing the way the world goes mad.

There is now a remarkable body of research that suggests that mental
illnesses are not, as sometimes assumed, spread evenly around the globe.
They have appeared in different cultures in endlessly complex and unique
forms. Indonesian men have been known to experience _amok_ , in which a
minor social insult launches an extended period of brooding punctuated by an
episode of murderous rage. Southeastern Asian males sometimes suffer from
_koro_ , the debilitating certainty that their genitals are retracting into their
body. Across the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East there is _zar,_ a mental
illness related to spirit possession that brings forth dissociative episodes of
crying, laughing, shouting, and singing.

The diversity that can be found across cultures can be seen across time as
well. Because the troubled mind has been perceived in terms of diverse
religious, scientific, and social beliefs of discrete cultures, the forms of
madness from one place and time in history often look remarkably different
from the forms of madness in another. These differing forms of mental illness
can sometimes appear and disappear within a generation. In his book _Mad
Travelers,_ Ian Hacking documents the fleeting appearance in Victorian
Europe of a fugue state in which young men would walk in a trance for
hundreds of miles. Symptoms of mental illnesses are the lightning in the
zeitgeist, the product of culture and belief in specific times and specific
places. That thousands of upper-class women in the mid-nineteenth century
couldn’t get out of bed due to the onset of hysterical leg paralysis gives us a
visceral understanding of the restrictions set on women’s social roles at the
time.

But with the increasing speed of globalization, something has changed. The
remarkable diversity once seen among different cultures’ conceptions of
madness is rapidly disappearing. A few mental illnesses identified and
popularized in the United States—depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,


and anorexia among them—now appear to be spreading across cultural
boundaries and around the world with the speed of contagious diseases.
Indigenous forms of mental illness and healing are being bulldozed by
disease categories and treatments made in the USA.

There is no doubt that the Western mental health profession has had a
remarkable global influence over the meaning and treatment of mental illness.
Mental health professionals trained in the West, and in the United States in
particular, create the official categories of mental diseases. The American
Psychiatric Association’s _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders_ , the _DSM_ (the “bible” of the profession, as it is sometimes
called), has become the worldwide standard. In addition American
researchers and organizations run the premier scholarly journals and host top
conferences in the fields of psychology and psychiatry. Western universities
train the world’s most influential clinicians and academics. Western drug
companies dole out the funds for research and spend billions marketing
medications for mental illnesses. Western-trained traumatologists rush in
wherever war or natural disasters strike to deliver “psychological first aid,”
bringing with them their assumptions about how the mind becomes broken
and how it is best healed.

These ideas and practices represent much more than the symptom lists that
describe these conditions. Behind the promotion of Western ideas of mental
health and healing lies a variety of cultural assumptions about human nature
itself. Westerners share, for instance, beliefs about what type of life event is
likely to make one psychologically traumatized, and we agree that venting
emotions by talking is more healthy than stoic silence. We are certain that
humans are innately fragile and should consider many emotional experiences
as illnesses that require professional intervention. We’re confident that our
biomedical approach to mental illness will reduce stigma for the sufferer and
that our drugs are the best that science has to offer. We promise people in
other cultures that mental health (and a modern style of self-awareness) can
be found by throwing off traditional social roles and engaging in
individualistic quests of introspection. These Western ideas of the mind are
proving as seductive to the rest of the world as fast food and rap music, and
we are spreading them with speed and vigor.

What motivates us in this global effort to convince the world to think like
us? There are several answers to this question, but one of them is quite
simple: drug company profits. These multibillion-dollar conglomerates have


an incentive to promote universal disease categories because they can make
fortunes selling the drugs that purport to cure those illnesses.

Other reasons are more complex. Many modern mental health practitioners
and researchers believe that the science behind our drugs, our illness
categories, and our theories of the mind have put the field beyond the
influence of constantly shifting cultural trends and beliefs. After all, we now
have machines that can literally watch the mind at work. We can change the
chemistry of the brain in a variety of ways and examine DNA sequences for
abnormalities. For a generation now we have proudly promoted the
biomedical notion of mental illness: the idea that these diseases should be
understood clinically and scientifically, like physical illnesses. The
assumption is that these remarkable scientific advances have allowed
modern-day practitioners to avoid the biases and mistakes of their
predecessors.

Indeed modern-day mental health practitioners often look back at previous
generations of psychiatrists with a mixture of scorn and pity, wondering how
they could have been so swept away by the cultural beliefs of their time.
Theories surrounding the epidemic of hysterical women in the Victorian era
are now dismissed as cultural artifacts. Even recent iatrogenic contagions,
such as the sudden rise of multiple personality disorder just fifteen years ago,
are considered ancient history, harmful detours but safely in the past.
Similarly, illnesses found only in other cultures are often treated like carnival
sideshows. _Koro_ and _amok_ and the like can be found far back in the
American diagnostic manual ( _DSM-IV_ , pages 845–849) under the heading
“Culture-Bound Syndromes.” They might as well be labeled “Psychiatric
Exotica: Two Bits a Gander.”

Western mental health practitioners are prone to believe that, unlike those
culturally contrived manifestations of mental illness, the 844 pages of the
_DSM-IV_ prior to the inclusion of culture-bound syndromes describe _real_
disorders of the mind, illnesses with symptomatology and outcomes
relatively unaffected by shifting cultural beliefs. And, the logic goes, if they
are unaffected by culture, then these disorders are surely universal to humans
everywhere. Their application around the world therefore represents simply
the brave march of scientific knowledge.

But the cross-cultural researchers and anthropologists profiled in this book
have a different story to tell. They have shown that the experience of mental


illness cannot be separated from culture. We can become psychologically
unhinged for many reasons, such as personal trauma, social upheaval, or a
chemical imbalance in our brain. Whatever the cause, we invariably rely on
cultural beliefs and stories to understand what is happening. Those stories,
whether they tell of spirit possession or serotonin depletion, shape the
experience of the illness in surprisingly dramatic and often counterintuitive
ways. In the end, all mental illnesses, including such seemingly obvious
categories such as depression, PTSD, and even schizophrenia, are every bit
as shaped and influenced by cultural beliefs and expectations as hysterical
leg paralysis, or the vapors, or _zar_ , or any other mental illness ever
experienced in the history of human madness.

The cultural influence on the mind of a mentally ill person is always a
local and intimate phenomenon. So although this book describes a global
trend, it is not told from a global perspective. In the hopes of keeping the
human-scale impact in sight, I have chosen to tell the stories of four diseases
in four different countries. I picked these tales because each illustrates how
the globalization of Western beliefs about mental health travel on different
currents. From the island of Zanzibar, where beliefs in spirit possession are
increasingly giving way to biomedical notions of mental illness, I tell the
story of two families struggling with schizophrenia. To document the rise of
anorexia in Hong Kong, I retrace the last steps of 14-year-old Charlene Hsu
Chi-Ying and show how the publicity surrounding her death introduced the
province to a particularly Western form of the disease. I deconstruct the
mega-marketing of the antidepressant Paxil in Japan to illustrate how drug
companies often sell the very disease for which their drug purports to be a
cure. The aftermath of the 2004 tsunami in Sri Lanka provides the opportunity
to examine the impact of trauma counselors who rush into disaster zones
armed with the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress and Western certainties
about the impact of trauma on the human psyche.

At the end of each of these chapters I turn the focus back to the West, and
to the United States in particular. When viewed from a far shore, the cultural
assumptions and certainties that shape our own beliefs about mental illness
and the human mind often become breathtakingly clear. From this
perspective, it is often our own assumptions about madness and the self that
begin to appear truly strange.

The cross-cultural psychiatrists and anthropologists featured in this book
have convinced me that we are living at a remarkable moment in human


history. At the same time they’ve been working hard to document the different
cultural understandings of mental illness and health, those differences have
been disappearing before their eyes. I’ve come to think of them as
psychology’s version of botanists in the rain forest, desperate to document
the diversity while staying only a few steps ahead of the bulldozers.

We should worry about this loss of diversity in the world’s differing
conceptions and treatments of mental illness in exactly the same way we
worry about the loss of biological diversity in nature. Modes of healing and
culturally specific beliefs about how to achieve mental health can be lost to
humanity with the grim finality of an animal or plant lapsing into extinction.
And like those plants and animals, the diversity in the human understanding
of the mind can disappear before we’ve truly comprehended its value.
Biologists suggest that within the dense and vital biodiversity of the rain
forest are chemical compounds that may someday cure modern plagues.
Similarly, within the diversity of different cultural understandings of mental
health and illness may exist knowledge that we cannot afford to lose. We
erase this diversity at our own peril.
